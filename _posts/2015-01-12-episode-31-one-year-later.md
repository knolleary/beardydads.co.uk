Episode 31 marks the first birthday of this podcast. We catch up on what happened over Christmas, how you handle the (_spoiler alert_) truth about Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy and what the future holds for this podcast.

Having recorded 31 episodes over the year, we&#8217;ve decided to draw this current chapter to a close. This isn&#8217;t the last episode by any means, we&#8217;re not stopping, just slowing down.
